			<h2>Course Description</h2>
			<p>COM 372 Web Design &amp; Development is a required course for all Communication Studies majors that serves as an introduction to the theory and practice of web design and development. Students will learn about the proper standards of web technologies while building accessible and usable web sites. No previous experience is necessary, and the course will center on beginner/intermediate aspects of web design and markup languages; specifically HyperText Markup Language (HTML5) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS3).</p>
			<p>Readings will focus on the Web’s architecture and its history, the basics of site development, and current conversations about best practices (such as responsive design, grid systems, user experience, digital video, and mobile technologies). Students will study web technologies and apply best practices to their own goals or interests–creating, for example, a personal web portfolio or a basic client project–while developing a rhetorical and technological understanding of web-based communication.</p>

			<h2>Course Overview</h2>
				<p>First, I want to stress, you do not need to be a 'techie', 'coder', or a geek to understand HTML and CSS. I have been working with HTML for fifteen years and CSS for ten years. I still would not call myself a programmer.</p>
				<p>Many web developers don't come from traditional educational channels; they are often self-taught, spending many hours studying and experimenting. I learned in high school by going to web sites, viewing the source code, and playing with it. This DIY attitude is what built the internet, the web (literally), and much of the technology we use. Much of the most innovative contributions to developing the computer technology we know today comes from the field's rich history of creation and collaboration; for example, open source projects such as Unix and the World Wide Web.</p>
				<p>With that said, this is an introductory class and I will treat it as such. I do not expect you to have any particular set of technological skills or knowledge. I am assuming each of you are a beginner and new to world of web design. What I do expect of you is to bring your curiosity and desire to learn to class and the readings. I want you to experiment, build things, break them, and use your critical thinking capabilities to fix them. Breaking things does not signify failure. It is a means of learning. I break things all of the time. I will probably accidentally break something when showing you how to do it. It happens. Learn from it. Like with learning anything, learning takes time, patience, and perseverance. </p>
				<p>For the first few weeks we will focus on learning HTML. I will show you the various tags, what they do, when you use them, and how to modify them with their attributes. I will even show you tags that are not standards compliant, explain why you should not use them, and show you what to do instead. Since they are not standards compliant, I expect that you will NOT use them in this class, however they are still important for you to know because they are artifacts of web sites past. Should you continue with web design, you will probably encounter them. In order to learn what to do, sometimes you need to learn what not to do. We will start working on an *.html version of your resume, adapting it each class with what we covered.</p>
				<p>After we have established the basics of HTML, we will learn CSS. CSS will render much of what we learned with HTML obsolete, particularly the attributes. That is okay for much of the same reason I described above. If you continue in web design beyond this class, you may encounter those things. I would rather you know them and not use them rather than leave you without the knowledge of their existence and what they do.</p>
				<p>Finally, we will combine your knowledge of HTML, CSS, with what you have been learning about design theory. The goal of the project we will work on in the remaining courses will be for you to design a professional web site using HTML5 and CSS3 code that is standards-compliant and follows Mobile First, Responsive Web Design, Grid-based Design, usability, and accessibility theories and practices. The site will have multiple pages, including a portfolio, about page, resume, and blog. It will link to and bring together your professional online presences and will be optimized to be viewed on a variety of web-enabled devices. The site will be designed in the following stages: sketching, wire-framing, prototyping, developing. This task sounds much more daunting than it should be if you kept up with the class objectives and assignments. As a way to enhance course collaboration and create a history of their team’s work, students will share and use design ideas in a class-wide subreddit.</p>
				<p>Students will also individually complete a midterm and final Story of Learning that presents and reflects on work completed during the semester in terms of each of the Course Learning Objectives.</p>
				<p>Should any aspect of class confuse/concern/trouble you, or if you have questions about any of the assignments, readings, or anything else, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>

			<h2>Grading</h2>
			<p>Learning how to design web pages using HTML and CSS is something that takes place over time. In the early stages, just getting a hang of how to upload files to the server is difficult and then at later stages learning nuances of CSS coding becomes a challenge. As a result, it is difficult to grade this work using number grades because skills vary so widely from student to student over the course of the semester.</p>
			<p>As a result, we will be using a system that allows you to track your learning over time so we be sure that each stage of your progress is documented and appreciated—by you. It also has a rather expansive understanding of what “work” is, so you are able to discuss drafts, failures, and mistakes in a way that helps you understand what you have learned and what has led to your successes.</p>
			<p><em class="u">Each week</em> you will complete a “<strong>Weekly Summary</strong>” and submit a 80-100 word file documenting the thing you learned that week, classmates you worked with (to do what?), classmates you helped (and how?), classmates who helped you (and how?), and anything you found particularly confusing. They will be due by the first class meeting the following week. For example, the first “Weekly Summary” for classes up to and including September 9th for section D01 will be due Monday, September 11th, by 1:19:59 pm. Each of these weekly summaries will be worth 10 points if completed on time, 5 points if late or halfway completed (not between 80-100 words), and 3 points if halfway completed and late. It is better to complete the work late than not at all.</p>
			<p>Come the end of the semester, the total score for your “Weekly Summaries” will be worth 25% of your grade. Collaboration will be worth 20% of your grade; this will include how often you work with other students in class and on the subreddit, however often you mention others in your weekly summaries, and how often others mention you. The midterm will be worth 25% of your grade as well. Half of it will be a writing assessment; the other half will be a project. Finally, your final will be worth 30% of your grade.</p>
			<p class="grading">Weekly Summary	25%</p>
			<p class="grading">Collaboration	20%</p>
			<p class="grading">Midterm	25%</p>
			<p class="grading">Final	30%</p>
			<p class="grading">Total	100%	</p>

			<p><strong>Midterm</strong>: The midterm will consist of a writing component and a project component. The project will be an html and css version of your resume. Your score will be based on the cleanliness of your code, if your code is standards compliant, design creativity, and the complexity of the page.</p>
			<p>The written component will consist of a 1,000 word essay detailing the grade you believe you should have by this point in the class. Base your reasons on the “Five Course Objectives” (Collaboration, Effective Communication, Human-Centered Design, Reflection, and Risk-taking), your Weekly Summaries to help you generate ideas. Conclude with where you would like to see your learning go and what you would like to accomplish by the end of the class.</p>
			<p><strong>Final</strong>: A fully functional website, details are still TBD.</p>
			<p><strong>A note on in-class discussions</strong>: Contribution to in-class discussion is expected in this class. That is, I expect all students in all class meetings to contribute thoughtful insights into the texts and the ideas discussed in class. Each member of our community of learning needs to be actively engaged in the learning process. Each student is here to contribute to the exchange of ideas. Ask questions. Be curious. As a student in this course you will create your own communal context for learning by engaging in conversations with others. As such, being prepared to participate in discussions and activities is paramount. This entails having read, annotated, and thought about the required materials carefully before class starts. The more you as students shape the conversations by engaging with each other, validating each other’s ideas, pushing each other, and asking each other questions without my prompting, the more this class will feel like a community and not just another class. No grade will be assigned for in-class participation; however, if your participation is lacking, it will seriously impact the Collaboration section of your Story of Learning. There may be times when the class meets in an online space rather than in the classroom. You’ll be notified ahead of time if this is the case.</p>
			<p><strong>A note on collaboration</strong>: All design is collaborative, as we will see in this class. Though our projects will be completed individually, we will be leaning on each other throughout our design processes for ideas, help, and feedback. I, too, will be learning from you, as you uncover new design tips and techniques found online. You are expected to be collegial, professional, thoughtful, mindful, polite, and open-minded in all of your interactions in the course, especially when visiting with clients. Significant moments that show a lack of collegiality, etc., can result the reduction in your grade.</p>
			<p><strong>A note about grades</strong>: Grades in the A-range are those that show the student working at levels significantly higher than what is expected. Grades at the B-level are those that show the student working at levels at or just above what is expected. Grades at the C-level and below are those that show the student working at levels below what is expected.</p>
			<p>All major assignments must be completed to pass the course. It is better to complete an assignment late then not to complete it at all.</p>

			<h2>Attendance</h2>
			<p>As this course is highly interactive with complex coding discussed nearly every meeting, your success is absolutely tethered to your presence and participation. The course will move quickly, and each successive meeting will build upon the concepts of the previous. Missing a class puts you at a serious disadvantage in terms of the larger semester arc. This is not the type of course where you can “ask for the notes” from a classmate and get the same learning experience. If you miss class you will miss something important and important in-class collaboration.</p>
			<p>Please come to class on time, prepared, having completed the assigned reading and writing, and ready to contribute to class discussions, to listen seriously and respectfully to the thoughts of others, and to participate in all in-class activities.</p>
			<p>According to the 2015-2016 Academic Catalog, “Credit and degree-seeking students are obliged to attend all classes and take all examinations. Absences totaling twice the number of hours the class meets a week will be permitted for illness or serious reasons” (p. 513). For our section of COM 372, this means students may miss up to 6 classes “without danger of failure due to absence” if—and only if—there is a “serious cause” (p. 513). This excludes common colds, car break-downs, etc. Absences for religious purposes do not count against the permitted number (as long as prior notification is given).</p>
			<p>Except for “serious reasons,” missing more than 2.5 classes will affect your grade. More than 6 absences will result in failing the course. Lateness counts as .5 of an absence. Leaving early will count as .5 of an absence. The grade reductions after 2.5 absences:</p>
			<p>3 absences = Partial letter grade (A to an A-)</p>
			<p>4 absences = 2 partial letter grades (A to a B+)</p>
			<p>5 absences = Full letter grade (A to a B)</p>
			<p>5 absences = A full letter grade and a partial letter grade (A to a B-)</p>
			<p>6.5 absences =  FA (failure due to absences)</p>
			<p>Your primary responsibility is to be in class and fully present.</p>
			<p>We will have a few required conferences throughout the semester where we discuss your progress in the class and questions you have. Missing a conference equals missing a day of class.</p>
			<p>If you are unable to make it, or will be late to, class or a conference, please inform before the class begins. Only under extreme cases will I accept reasons after you've already missed the class (even then, the window is only open a few days after the class met). I will NOT accept any reasons for missing a class at the end of the semester.</p>

			<h2>Resources</h2>
			<h3>A note on Academic Technology</h3>
			<p>Because this is an upper-level course, you are expected to be familiar with the department’s approach to using digital technologies: experiment, take risks, and play.</p>
			<p>However, as much as technology makes life easier, at times it can also be difficult (computer crashes, deleted work, slow internet connection, etc.). Plan accordingly: “the computer ate my homework” or “the internet was down” are not reasons to forgo doing the assigned work. It is in your best interest to leave extra time, and back up frequently, especially at first to ensure that technology does not get in the way of your work.</p>
			<p>That being said, I will never refuse to accept a project because of difficulty using academic technology. The software and applications we use are a means to complete the work, not the work itself. The software is often new and sometimes still has bugs. I am aware of this and am aware that problems can happen. If you run into trouble, let me know as soon as possible so I can help you work through it. There is no reason to sit for hours getting more and more frustrated. Send me an email with as detailed a description of your problem as possible and we’ll figure out what is going on.</p>
			<p>If you are having trouble getting a project completed on time (for whatever reason) please let me know about your delays as soon as possible. It is better to complete an assignment late then to not complete it at all, and I am more than happy to work with you so you can compete the best project you can.</p>
			<h3>Universal Learning</h3>
			<p>I am committed to the principle of universal learning. This means that our classroom, our virtual spaces, our practices, and our interactions be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen and observe others carefully are crucial to universal learning.</p>
			<p>Any student with particular learning needs should contact the Student Success Center at 610-660-1041. The Center is located in Bellarmine Hall. The staff is available to answer questions regarding accommodations or assist you in your pursuit of accommodations. Then you and I can work out the details of any accommodations needed for this course.</p>
			<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>
			<p>Requests for Accommodations: Reasonable academic accommodations may be provided to students who submit appropriate documentation of their disability. Students are encouraged to contact Dr. Christine Mecke in the Office of Student Disability Services, Bellarmine, B-10, at cmecke@sju.edu; or at 610.660.1774 (voice), or 610.660.1620 (TTY), for assistance with this issue. The university also provides an appeal/grievance procedure regarding requested or offered reasonable accommodations through Dr. Mecke’s office. More information: <a href="www.sju.edu/sds">Office of Student Disabilities</a>.</p>
			<p>Grievance Procedures for Students with Disabilities, Appeal Process: The Office of Student Disability Services will seek to provide reasonable accommodations to qualified students with disabilities. However, there may be times when a disagreement as to what is considered a reasonable accommodation will occur between the student and the University. The student has a right to file a grievance for complaints regarding a requested or offered reasonable accommodation on the basis of a disability under Section 504 and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and University policies. If you have any questions regarding the appeals process, please contact Dr. Christine Mecke, Director Student Disability Services – Bellarmine – Room G10 – cmecke@sju.edu.</p>
			<p>For further information regarding accommodations, please see: <a href="https://sites.sju.edu/thesuccesscenter/">The Success Center</a>.</p>
			<h3>Writing center</h3>
			<p>You will write in this class. If you are particularly concerned about your writing or think you might benefit from extra support, SJU has a writing center with peer tutors trained to help with all kinds of assignments. Locations are in Merion Hall (room 162) and Post Learning Commons (room 128). You can drop in during open hours or make an appointment online.</p>
			<h3>Digital Media Zone (DMZ)</h3>
			<p>The <a href="http://www.sju.edu/int/academics/resources/atdl/dmz.html">DMZ</a> is a great resource if you need help working through the technical aspects of this class, such as Google docs or image editing. They have trained staff and fancy computers. The <a href="http://www.sju.edu/int/academics/resources/atdl/dmz.html">DMZ</a> is located on the second floor of the library. </p>
			<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
			<p>Please familiarize yourself with the <a href="http://hawkcentral.sju.edu/link/portal/16125/16171/Article/95/Academic-Honesty-Policy">University’s Academic Honesty Policy.</a></p>
		</article>
		<article id="ett">
			<h3>Digital Etiquette</h3>
			<p>Many of the assignments throughout the semester will require participation in online spaces. Students should work to preserve the same atmosphere of respect and consideration that occurs in the classroom. Disagreements may arise and consensus is not always possible (indeed disagreements are productive). However, name calling, bullying, harassing, shaming, flaming, trolling, etc. is antithetical to the goals of this course and decent humanity. This behavior may be met with a temporary ban from the subreddit, which will negatively impact your participation in the offline discussion of the course. Any discussions on the subreddit that are not related to class material are subject to deletion (“Let's get some brews, brah!”)</p>
			<h3>Email Etiquette</h3>
			<p>There will be times during the semester when I will need to contact the class and you will need to contact me. I will contact you via your SJU email account, so please be sure you are checking it regularly and/or forwarding it to the email service you use most regularly. I do not recommend calling me on my office phone.</p>
			<p>I strongly suggest you contact me via email or message me on Reddit ('nciervo'). Email tends to be seen as an informal medium. This, however, should not always be the case. All emails that I send to you will have a meaningful subject line and a proper salutation (“Hi Class,” or “Hi Jane,” etc.). The first sentence will notify you of the purpose of the email, and then will get to the heart of the matter. It will end with a formal closing (“Thanks, BW”). (See this article on contacting a professor when going to be absent.) I expect the same from any email you send. Reddit is less formal, so feel free to just message me questions. </p>
			<p>I’ll get back to your messages and emails as soon as possible—usually within half a day. If I don’t get back within a day, it may be that I did not see your message or email for one reason or another, such as an email going in my spam folder. Send me a polite reminder and/or ask me in class if I got it, and I’ll get back immediately.</p>
			<h3>Computer Classroom Etiquette</h3>
			<p>These general guidelines will help make your overall course experience more effective, productive, and educational:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>When someone is speaking and you are not asked to be following on your computer, please turn and face that person. Everything the instructor is doing on the computer will be projected onto the screen in the front of the classroom.</p></li>
					<li><p>This class is made up of students with widely varying levels of computer expertise. If you have technical experience, please be considerate of those who do not. Do not act bored during these times of instruction, since that will distract others and alienate you from them. Instead, offer what help you can to others if they seem lost or confused. You will not only help your colleague (who may mention you in their Story of Learning), but you will create a collaborative atmosphere in the class, both of which are only to your advantage.</p></li>
					<li><p>If you are a novice computer user, do not be afraid of asking questions, even when it seems that everyone around you is “getting it.” I will not know what areas are mysterious unless someone asks for clarification, and they will be more than happy to answer your questions. The chances are good that if you don’t understand something that others don’t either, and your I need to know this. Don’t be intimidated into silence. If you are uncomfortable asking a question in front of everyone or on the class' subreddit, you can always email me. I reserve the right to share the question with the class, but I will leave you anonymous.</p></li>
					<li><p>When communicating with classmates online please pay special attention to how you word things. Electronic communication is wonderful for many reasons, but because tone is not readily apparent, often times things are misinterpreted and people can get quite hurt.</p></li>
					<li><p>Be sure to bring to class all your required materials. If you have time in class to work on projects, don’t work on other courses or personal business. Make use of your limited time in the classroom, ask me and your classmates questions, and take advantage of the opportunities the course and the classroom offers you. Always log out of the computer before leaving for the day.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>There will be times when I ask you to put your phones, tablets, and computers away so we can focus on the discussion.</p>
			<h3>Firearms Policy</h3>
			<p>According to the <a href="http://www.sju.edu/int/resources/humanresources/firearmspolicy.html">Human Resources</a> section of the SJU website and the SJU Student Handbook (January 14, 2016),</p>
			<blockquote cite="http://www.sju.edu/int/resources/humanresources/firearmspolicy.html"><p>The carrying, or presence, of a firearm is not permitted on University property, including, but not limited to, one’s vehicle, office, residence or locker, except when the firearm is carried by a deputized law enforcement officer and/or agent who is conducting official business on University property.</p>
			<p>The University policy concerning the prohibition against the carrying, and presence, of firearms on campus, is intended to conform to applicable statutes of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Such statutes define firearms as any pistol, revolver, shotgun, or any weapon which is capable of firing a projectile.</p></blockquote>

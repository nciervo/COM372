    <h2>Sports</h2>
    <h3>The Phillies are bad</h3>
    <p>Your shoes' unbelted. (Marty Jr. looks. Griff pushes him and the gang laugh. Griff then pulls Marty Junior up.) So McFly, have you made a decision about tonight's opportunity? Marty Jr.Um, yeah Griff, you know, I was thinking about it and I'm not sure it's a good idea because I just think it might just be a little bit dangerous. (Spike feels Marty Jr.'s face with her finger. Marty Jr. groans a bit.) What's wrong McFly? You got no scrote? (She moves her hand so it digs into Marty Junior's “private area”.) Marty Jr.Ooh!</p>
    <h3>The Sixers? Also, bad</h3>
    <p>Excuse me. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Uh, coast guard. Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age.</p>
    <h2>News</h2>
    <h3>Everything is great!</h3>
    <p>Room service? (o.s) Lorraine! Oh my God, it's your father. My father? (Biff enters. This Biff is dressed up in a suit, and has a yellowy-ginger hair colour rather than the grey he had at the start of the film. 3-D, Match and Skinhead are with him.)</p>
